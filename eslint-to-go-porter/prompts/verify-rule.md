You are reviewing a Go rule that was converted from TypeScript. Please verify the implementation is correct.

## Original TypeScript Rule

```typescript
{{RULE_SOURCE}}
```

## Converted Go Rule Path

The Go rule has been written to: `{{GO_RULE_PATH}}`

## Instructions

1. Read the Go rule file at the path above
2. Verify the conversion is accurate and complete
3. Check that all edge cases from the TypeScript version are handled
4. Ensure the Go code follows idiomatic patterns
5. Verify imports are correct
6. Check that the rule structure matches rslint conventions

If you find any issues, fix them. Otherwise, confirm the rule is correctly implemented.

Respond with either:
- "VERIFIED" if the rule is correct
- The corrected Go code if fixes are needed
